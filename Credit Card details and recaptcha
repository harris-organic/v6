 A customer ordered some items with a Credit Card. I received the order with credit card details. I changed from recaptcha invisible
 to V2 and viola, the credit card details were blank.

I then made a dummy order and could repeat the above.  Current CC version is 6.1.8 and Credit card capture 1.0.5
